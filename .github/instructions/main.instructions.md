Project Context: This project is a lightweight recommendation system for Football Manager. The system is designed to provide users with personalized team recommendations based on their preferences and past interactions. The frontend is built using React and Vite, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

Coding Guidelines:

1. Use functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for building React components.
2. Follow a modular architecture by organizing components into separate files and folders. Components folder structure should follow a clear naming convention and be organized by feature.
3. Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
4. Write clean, maintainable code with proper indentation and formatting.
5. Include comments and documentation where necessary to explain complex logic or components.
6. Always explain the reasoning behind code changes or implementations.
